##### Object Detection and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) on the [Husarion Rosbot](https://husarion.com/manuals/rosbot/)

##### To perform Object Detection we use [the April Tag 3 Visual Fiducial Detection Algorithm.](http://wiki.ros.org/apriltag_ros). To reproduce our configuration, see the config/settings.yaml and config/tags.yaml files.

  

##### For SLAM we use the [OpenSlam Gmapping package](https://wiki.ros.org/gmapping).

##### FinalProject.py - contains our logic for autonomous line follow, in which the  ROSbot relies on  the input from the RGBD sensor to detect and follow a white line.

##### FinalProjectManual.py - contains our logic to manually steer the ROSbot using the Linux joystick.
